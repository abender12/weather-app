# weather-app
This weather app will tell you the weather based on the city you search.

# Description
This weather app allows the user to find the weather of a city the type into the search bar. When the user searches the city, the current forecast and the 5 day forecast appear with wind speed, humidity, and temperature, as well as an icon depicting the weather conditions of that day. The greatest challenge completing this for me was using the API Key and getting the weather icons to show up. I also struggled not knowing which urls to use in the fetch command, but with the Weather API Docs I was able to figure it out.

# Getting Started

## Dependencies 
Windows 10

## Installing
Clone the code from GitHub to your local file. You will need an API Key from the Weather API(https://openweathermap.org/api).

## Credits
I used the Library of Congress Mini Project from the UoR Bootcamp to help me with this Challenge.
